TO DO:

GENERAL:
    > add code signing
    >> Make licensing window
    >> Make about window
    Implement the ASCII/CSV transformers
    Interpolation
    Normalize Y to 100%
    Smoothen
    Add Controller
    Write UNIT tests -> some internal changes screwed up bar/laser with graph connections; testing prevents these errors
    Add a way to intercept all Errors and parse those to a popup window / possible?
    Probably not, but implement logging as a better alternative!
    Including logging window! which is openable independently and is updated on every log event
    A way to save the view
    A way to load the view
    A way to export the plots
    Sometimes (exp shift+windows_key) moves the window, this should close all open drop-down menu's.

PARSERS
    > TEST QSettings settings on macintosh, does it follow the QApp defined names

DATA:
    Implement validity check upon new data: check if sorted low->high. 
    I use binary searches for speedy data manipulation. This require a sorted std::vector

CACHE:
    In common usage check to what size the unordered_map grow, now just a guess
    Write correction upon counter overflow
    Write correction when unordered_map grows to big

FLUOR:
    if fluorophore name too long gets squeezed by scroll_widget, way to solve this nicely?

TOOLBAR:
    Check if Icon resizing algorithm works on MacOS

LASER & FLUOR:
    If selected plot with laser -> see if entree in QModel, if so -> select

GRAPH:
    Save graph properties and reload upon opening -> for now disabled cause it breaks the BarLayout
    GraphPlot in Square instead of line upon certain size / option?
    'black' axes face_color option allow for white out of visible spectrum plotting
    Add Object for non-sequential lasers
    Colinear lasers object
    Selection in Plot -> see statistics of each plot
    More indepth detector plotting, also taking into account the dichromatic mirrors etc.
