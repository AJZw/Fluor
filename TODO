TO DO:

GENERAL:
    >> Make about window (with licensing info)
    Add a way to intercept all Errors and parse those to a popup window / possible?
    Implement logging as a better alternative! -> capture QDebug() messages and output to window
    Including logging window! which is openable independently and is updated on every log event
    A way to save the view
    A way to load the view
    A way to export the plots
    Sometimes (exp shift+windows_key) moves the window, this should close all open drop-down menu's.

DATA:
    Implement json parser for new fluorophore spectra data structure
    Implement two_photon excitation

CACHE:
    In common usage check to what size the unordered_map grow, now just a guess
    >> To make more consistent with rest of the state mechanisms, remove the Q_OBJECT / signal+slot required -> move it to State::Program

LASER & FLUOR:
    If selected plot with laser -> see if entree in QModel, if so -> select
    Upon DPI change the rowSizeHint lags behind one paint(), which can cause imperfect popup size. Not sure you can work your way around this one.

GRAPH:
    Save graph properties and reload upon opening -> for now disabled cause it breaks the BarLayout
    'black' axes face_color option allow for white out of visible spectrum plotting
    Colinear lasers object
    Selection in Plot -> see statistics of each plot

MAC:
    TEST QSettings settings on macintosh, does it follow the QApp defined names
    Check stylesheet
    Add code signing on MacOS
