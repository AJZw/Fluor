TO DO:

GENERAL:
    Add a way to intercept all Errors and parse those to a popup window / possible?
    Implement logging as a better alternative! -> capture QDebug() messages and output to window
    Including logging window! which is openable independently and is updated on every log event
    A way to save the view
    A way to load the view
    A way to export the plots
    Sometimes (exp shift+windows_key) moves the window, this should close all open drop-down menu's.
    Make the backup style more user-interactable (hover/click borders)
    Upon moving to screen with different DPI settings, a setGeometry error is fired. Preventable?

DATA:
    Implement two_photon excitation

CACHE:
    In common usage check to what size the unordered_map grow, now just a guess

LASER & FLUOR:
    Upon DPI change the rowSizeHint lags behind one paint(), which can cause imperfect popup size. Not sure you can work your way around this one.
    Maybe by manually reapplying the delegate on the item (see source QStandardItem::sizeHint / paint)

GRAPH:
    Scaling intensity axis when more then 1 laser is enabled
    Properly set amount of graph columns, so no clipping happens in lower widths
    'black' axes face_color option allow for white out of visible spectrum plotting

MAC:
    TEST QSettings settings on macintosh, does it follow the QApp defined names
    Check stylesheet
    Check menubar
    Add code signing on MacOS
